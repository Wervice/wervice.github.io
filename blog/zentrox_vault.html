			<h2>Intro</h2>
			I have working on a project called
			<a href="https://github.com/wervice/zentrox">Zentrox</a> (which you really
			should star) for a while now.<br />
			This project lets you set up a server admin-dashboard on your home server,
			laptop...<br />
			By now, some of the features are already partially done. i.e A FTP server,
			system stats overview,...<br />
			Another part of Zentrox is "Vault".<br />
			<br />
			<h2>What is Vault</h2>
			Vault will let you set up a simple but secure folder on your server.<br />
			In this folder, you can store private files like photos, documents,...<br />
			It is/will be integrated with Zentrox by default and place under Storage
			&gt; Vault.<br /><br />
			<h2>How does it work</h2>
			<select id="date_select">
				<option value="6-15-24">6/15/24</option>
				<option value="6-16-24">6/16/24</option>
			</select>
			<br>
			<i> ‚ö†Ô∏è This may all change üëá</i><br />
			<h3 id="6-15-24">6/15/24</h3>
			Firstly, the user has to configure a key for Zentrox Vault.<br />
			Vault will then take the key and perform hashing on it for 1000 times.
			That way, it will be very hard to brute force the password later, as the
			hashing takes a bit of time and would slow brute forcing a lot.<br />
			After the password is hashed, it is used as the key for a AES 256 GCM
			encryption.<br />
			The encryption is applied to a gziped tar archive. By now, this only
			includes a single file with no relevant content.<br />
			As soon as the encryption is finished, the result may look like this:<br />
			<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "c": "18e2c33ccfa4817b4fd8b27131bdb9fb8aaccd12051655ba7e3481b1df7d6d8ce17ec1c09abfac0f4655b5cedba8ca04cada1e6f505d3d25586ebeb92120842780c0169ece821ef439f8905e2...",
  "i": "fbabce2b28474067b08a75af06d1bced75e770c16c0e3ff787562b26d40e41da2240cda46276a6f7ae8ff47396cbed945573e7d960869bb957b8345316e3499602b0b1d83f71dd992de66c7a4bcb627041df078340638c12f9355499d2d3d48a",
  "t": "e4f6ba670160923d7f8aa6543ad95ab1",
  "s": "c661f93d7e09d68f3195c910e98a94c452e22156c491c0b2c8eeedd7898b6e59"
}</code></pre>
			<br />
			There is only one big problem with this. The file is
			<strong>way</strong> to big for a tar archive with a 4 letter string
			inside.<br />
			So, lets explore the content of this file.<br />
			We can see four different parts in this JSON: c, i, t and s.<br />
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>c</td>
					<td>Ciphertext</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>i</td>
					<td>Initialization Vector</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>t</td>
					<td>Tag</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>s</td>
					<td>Salt</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			The ciphertext contains the actual encrypted data. It may vary in size a
			lot.<br />
			The
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector">IV</a> is
			used for AES encryption and stays around 96 bits.<br />
			The tag is used to check if the decrypted data can be authenticated. It
			should not vary in size a lot.<br />
			Lastly the salt is used to hash the key one last time, thus making the
			vault resistant agains
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a>.
			<br />
			<br />
			The problem with all of this is, that the data is stored in
			<b>hexadecimal</b> ü§¶. Yes, Binary data is converted into Hex, so I can
			store it in my JSON.
			<br />
			This means, that the next thing I will have to do is to use a
			<code>Buffer</code> instead of JSON.
			<h3 id="6-16-24">6/16/24</h3>
			After I replaced the JSON with a Buffer and am not storing binary as hex
			data anymore, the encrypted data is now half as big.<br />
			The next part of Vault is adding support for uploading and downloading files.
