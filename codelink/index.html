        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <div id="text">The idea behind Codelink is having a central place that has all the tools a developer may need whatever you
            are working on.<br>I want to integrate some existing programs, I know that I can not replace, but lots of
            devs use and some custom tools I create myself to Codelink. This means, that Codelink will be a long
            project, which will not come to an end any time soon.</div>

        <h3>Codelink Browser</h3>
        <p>
            This is a specialized browser for fixing bugs and errors. It also has a
            research assistant build-in that helps getting better Google results.
            The basic tools of any browser, like bookmarks are also included. It uses
            the Chromium rendering engine (<code>webview</code>).

        <h3>Codelink FileTree</h3>
        <p>
            Besides the implementation of already existing software, Codelink has its own
            inteligent filemanger, focused on coding and encryption. It lets you do all
            things like Copy, Move,... and also gives you extra features like encryption
            and terminal launchers.
        </p>

    <div class="feature" id="f_links">
        <h3>Codelink Links</h3>
        <p>
            There are dozens of programs out there that devs use. I wont replace (them all), but you can run them easily by selecting a code editor, terminal and filemanager. <!--
                ! Finish. Then CSS. Then goback to Codelink and finish encryption feature. Screenshots here missing. Remove
                ! comments. SIMONE 17:30

    <div id="opensource_information">
        <h2>It's open source</h2>
        All Codelink parts are 100% open source and free. However, I would be very happy if you could star
        the <a href="https://github.com/Wervice/Codelink">repo on GitHub</a>.
